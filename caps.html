                    Individual Peer Counseling(IPC) is a way for students to receive counseling from a fellow students at UMSI and serves as an alternative to receiving counseling from an adult, which may be more scary for some people. Our primary goal is to listen and support you, and provide resources where needed.<br><br>

                    Students interested in receiving peer counseling can submit this form:

                    <br> or can be referred from a CAPS counselor to one of our Peer Counselors.
